(I'm) sitting here and looking at a foreign sky through a foreign window  
And (I) don't see a single familiar star  
I've walked on all roads (to) here and there  
Turned arround and couldn't see (my) footprints  

But if in my pocket there's a pack of cigarettes  
Then everything isn't that bad on this day  
And a ticket for a plane with a silver wing  
That takes off leaving only a shadow on earth  

And nobody wanted to be guilty without some reason (pun, could be translated to wine)  
And noone wanted to do the dangerous work (literal = and noone wanted to move the hot coals with their hands)  
But for us without music even death isn't beautiful  
Don't want to dissapear without music (dissapear could be translated to die, but literal sounds better imo)  

But if in my pocket there's a pack of cigarettes  
Then everything isn't that bad on this day  
And a ticket for a plane with a silver wing  
That takes off leaving only a shadow on earth  

(these lines have the chorus echo/delay on the last word)  
But if in my pocket there's a pack of cigarettes  
Then everything isn't that bad on this day  
And a ticket for a plane with a silver wing  
That takes off leaving only a shadow on earth

# Zvesda po imeni solntse | The star by the name of Sun

White snow, grey ice  
On the cracked earth  
Like a patchwork quilt on it  
(A) City on a loop of the road  
Above the city the clouds are swimming  
Blocking off the sky light (sky could also be translated to heavenly)  
And above the city there's yellow smoke  
The city is 2000 years old  
Lived under the light of a star  
By the name of Sun  

And war for 2000 years  
War withought particulate reasons  
War of for the young  
Medicine against wrinkles  
Red Red blood  
After an hour (it's) just earth  
After 2 there's already grass and flowers on it  
After 3 it's alive again  
And warmed by the light of a star  
By the name of Sun  

And we know that's its always been like this  
Who fate loves more  
Who lives by their own rules  
And who dies young  
He doesn't remember the words yes and no  
He doesn't remember ranks nor names  
And can reack for the stars  
Not thinking it was a dream  
And to fall, burned by the star  
By the name of Sun
